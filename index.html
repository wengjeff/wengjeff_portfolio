				<h2>Welcome to Weng Jeff's site</h2>
				<p>Hello guys, This is a site that I created to let other people to know more about me. </p>
				<p> I'm a web designer, I'm write HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and more. I love learning new things too. That why I still learning now. I learn about coding especially in web development.</p>
				<h2>Who am i?</h2>
				<script type="text/javascript">
					var year  = new Date();
					var age = year.getFullYear() - 1995;
						document.write("<p>My name is Lee Weng Jeff, people called me Jeff. I'm " + age + " this year.")
				</script>
					Come from a country named <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia">Malaysia</a>. I'm also a student at <a href = "http://www.segi.edu.my/en/campus/segi-college-subang-jaya">SEGi college Subang Jaya</a> taking diploma in Information Technology.</p>
				<h2>Why I choose coding?</h2>
				<p>After my secondary school, I have to choose an college and what to study, My aunt suggest me to study in Information technology and I'm totally new in this kind of thing coding, management and all those weird computer stuff. When i started to study, I insterest in one of the class and that is web design. I impressed with the design and how code can work like a MAGIC! So, I start learning by myself. That make me self-taught. I start learning from zero. HTML, <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a> then <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, <a href = "http://jquery.com/">Jquery</a>. Instead of front-end I also learning back-end development like Ruby on Rails.</p>
				<h2>Where I learn to code?</h2>
				<p>After I know about coding I want to learn more from it, The first resourse that I know I can learn is from <a href = "http://www.youtube.com">Youtube</a>, There are million of tutorial video out there FREE! I start to learn some basic CSS and JavaScript at there. Another resourse that I learn is <a href = "http://teamtreehouse.com">Teamtreehouse</a>, Is a online learning site that teach people how to code, but it will charge $25 dollar monthly. I take it because I personal think this is a good invesment for myself and YES! I do learn a lot from there! Thanks Teamtreehouse! The third site that I found and I also recommended to those who want to start coding before going to site who need to paid. That is <a href = "http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>. It free and it have anything that we need to learn how to code!</p>
